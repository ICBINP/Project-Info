# ICBINP

The idea is to model RPG games and have the ability to create new characters with traits, weapons, names and so forth. The characters live in a pineapple-farming village which is the setting for the story. Once created, each character can be sent out on a choose-your-own-adventure-style story quest that will have an effect on the character’s attributes..
Our backend database will contain each user’s character information and details, and the frontend will be the place that the user can access CRUD functionalities.
